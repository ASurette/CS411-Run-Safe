# CS411-Run-Safe

The only new code here is in the public folder. It is what creates the  map and generates random routes...still a work in progress.


The important files are:
  public > index.html
  public > javascripts > OnAndOff.js
  public > javascripts > RouteLoops.js
  public > javascripts > jquery-1.4.2.js
  public > stylesheets > style.css
 
I was trying to incorporate the Spotcrime API in public > javascripts > index.js ...still a work in progress there.
